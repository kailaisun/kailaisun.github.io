I am a Ph.D. in the Department of Automation, Tsinghua University. As a member of [CFINS](http://cfins.au.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), I'm supervised by [Prof. Qianchuan Zhao](http://cfins.au.tsinghua.edu.cn/personalhg/zhaoqc/). I received my Bachelor of Engineering degree from Department of Automation, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT)  in 2018. 

My research interest lies in smart building and deep learning, including building occupancy detection/estimation, computer vision and generative model. 
I have published more than 10 papers at top international journals, including *Building and environment, Energy and buildings, Cell Patterns*.
